      "description": "This stunning third part to Kate Hennig’s powerful Queenmaker Series, England’s first queen finds herself fighting xenophobia, religious nationalism, and strained familial bonds in the power struggle that dubs her Bloody Mary. Upon the death of King Edward VI, the thirty-eight-year-old princess Mary—daughter of Henry VIII —wrests the throne from Edward’s deemed heir, Lady Jane. Relentless even in death, Mary’s mother appears in memory and adamantly questions the motives of Mary’s cousin Jane and her half-sister Bess, despite Mary’s affection for them both. As England splits along Roman Catholic and Protestant lines, Mary balances the razor’s edge of ethics and politics to hold onto her own sanity. Should she execute her opponents before it’s too late, the way her father did? Should she scramble to find a husband who can give her a rightful heir? Who can be trusted? Her mother, her sister, or even herself?",

A Man for All Seasons is the story of Sir Thomas More, an English statesman, lawyer, and Lord High Chancellor of England under King Henry VIII. Once the King’s beloved teacher, More’s relationship to the King fractures when he refuses to take the Oath of Supremacy swearing allegiance to the monarchy as the head of the Church of England and legitimizing the annulment of Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Guided by the Common Man (who also plays a number of ensemble parts), the play follows More as he is confronted by his beloved family, who contrast starkly with powerful Cardinal Wolsey and the opportunistic Richard Rich. Young King Henry VIII, drunk on power and wine, burdened by sin, and determined to secure an heir to the throne, demands More’s help. More’s beloved family want him home and safe. Chockful of moments of rich humor and transparent theatricality in modern style, More navigates his way through the maze of Henry’s marriages, potential martyrdom, and the north star of his own morality.",

Eager to use Harvard’s telescope—the Great Refractor—Harriet is told that she will not be able to do any sort of astronomical discovery.

Wilder compresses time by moving characters onstage through generations of adolescence, marriage, parenthood, and maturity. Like his later masterpiece, Our Town, Wilder's play captures and celebrates the sweet and poignant transitory joys of family life.\r\nAct 2: In A Christmas Memory, Truman Capote recalls an idyllic Southern holiday season when as a young boy he baked fruitcakes, gathered holly, and flew kites with the beloved eccentric cousin who raised him and inspired him to become a writer.

      "description": "“Based on Joseph Moncure March’s 1928 narrative poem of the same name, this darkly brilliant show features one of the most exciting, pulse-racing scores ever written. Lovers Queenie and Burrs decide to throw the party-to-end-all-parties in their Manhattan apartment. After the colorful arrival of a slew of guests living life on the edge, Queenie’s wandering eyes land on a striking man named Black. As the decadence is reaching a climax, so is Burrs’ jealousy, which erupts and sends him into a violent rage. Gun in hand and inhibitions abandoned, Burrs turns on Queenie and Black. The gun gets fired, but who’s been shot?” (Music Theatre International)",
